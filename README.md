Sub7a is a Flutter application designed to help users track their Istighfar (seeking forgiveness from Allah) count and achieve their daily goals. The app allows users to set a target count for Istighfar and tracks their progress towards that goal. It also displays the total count of Istighfar repetitions and the total number of sessions.
